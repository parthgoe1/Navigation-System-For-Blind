Differently-abled people comprise 2.21 % of the Indian population.
As per WHO, out of 7 billion people in the world, 15% of the world population faces
some kind of disability such as vision, physical, hearing or speaking issues. This project
focuses on the problems of vision. I propose a Computer Vision model interfaced with a mobile
application that can be a better alternative for visually impaired people as compared to
the already existing hardware solutions. This is a step
towards bridging the gap between the normal and differently abled people. The results
show that the proposed method is effective in the real-world environment.</br>

SixthDetection.ipynb is without the GPS and is self sufficient Python file.</br>

SeventhDetection.ipynb has GPS included and needs Location.ipynb and url.txt to run.
